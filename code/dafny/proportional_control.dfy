/*
    Simple proportional control.
    Obtains input data for the reference and the feedback, and
    generates a proportional control value using the equation:

    u = Kp(r â€“ b) + P

    b is obtained from c * Kb, where c is the output of the
    controlled device or system (the plant), and Kb is a gain
    applied to scale it into the same range as the r (reference)
    input.

    The gain parameters Kp and Kb should be set to something
    meaningful for a specific application. The P parameter is
    the bias to be applied to the output.
